# Fraud Finder: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-world banking data is a vital, high-impact data science problem. This project demonstrates end-to-end best practices for machine learning on highly imbalanced datasets, culminating in a performant, interpretable fraud detector.



## Project Highlights

- **Feature Engineering**: Cyclical time features and log-transformed amounts boost model accuracy.
- **Advanced Imbalance Handling**: Uses LightGBM with `class_weight='balanced'` to address class imbalance natively.
- **Model Evaluation**: Focus on precision, recall, and confusion matrix for transparent performance.
- **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit app (`app.py`) for live predictions and visualization of model performance.



## Results

- **Fraud Precision**: `1.00`
- **Fraud Recall**: `0.82`
- **AUPRC**: `0.8556`
![Model Evaluation](public/model_eval.png)

Our best LightGBM model achieves perfect precision (1.00) for fraud detection and a recall of 0.82, with an AUPRC of 0.8556 which is generally considered exceptional for such an imbalanced domain. This means the model reliably catches fraudulent transactions with virtually zero false alarms.



## Getting Started

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/89jobrien/fraud-finder.git
cd fraud-finder
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (with Virtual Environment Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Download the Dataset

- [Kaggle Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Place the downloaded `creditcard.csv` file in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

### Option 1: Train the Production Model

Train the final model and save the serialized artifacts (`model.joblib` and `scaler.joblib`):

```bash
python build.py
```

### Option 2: Run the Interactive App

Start the Streamlit interface for single-transaction predictions:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üê≥ Deploy with Docker

Portable, reproducible deployments are an industry must-have. This project includes a sample Dockerfile for fast containerization.

### 1. Create a `Dockerfile` in the Project Root

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY pyproject.toml .
RUN pip install uv && uv pip install --system .

COPY . .

RUN python build.py

EXPOSE 8501

CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

### 2. Build and Run

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t fraud-finder .

# Run the Streamlit app in a container
docker run -p 8501:8501 fraud-finder
```

Your interface will now be available at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
